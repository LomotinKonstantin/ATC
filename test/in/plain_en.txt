Using Monte Carlo simulations a lattice gas model with only repulsive interactions was checked for the presence of anomalies. We show that this system exhibits the density (temperature of maximum density_-TMD) and diffusion anomalies as present in liquid water. These anomalous behaviors exist in the region of the chemical potential vs temperature phase diagram where two structured phases are present. A fragile-to-strong dynamic transition is also observed in the vicinity of the TMD line.
