B150720803779	NEW RADIOACTIVE WASTE IMMOBILIZATION FORMS	Radioactive waste management is one of the key problems of nuclear energy. High level waste (HLW) especially actinide bearing is the most dangerous because long-lived actinides have high radiation and chemical toxicity. HLW is processed by incorporation in aluminophosphate (in Russia) or borosilicate glass. Glasses have some disadvantages which cannot guarantee reliability of HLW immobilization for geological periods. We proposed sodium alumino-iron phosphate glasses with higher devitrification and chemical durability but the safety level required at storage may be provided by only mineral-like materials. Especially designed ceramic waste forms similar to natural rocks are capable to incorporate various HLW constituents including actinides. Among them the materials designed by ourselves forming zoned nanostructures locating the most dangerous HLW isotopes _- actinides in the core of the grains providing their strong immobilization for a long time. To produce new materials special technologies for example cold crucible inductive melting and self-sustaining high-temperature synthesis are under development now. They are the most suitable for production of glass-crystalline materials combining advantages of glasses and ceramics. At that nano-sized crystals of actinide-bearing phases are distributed in glassy matrix concentrating fission ((Cs, Sr, ÐÇÝ, Tc, Mo) and corrosion (Al, Cr, Fe, Ni) products providing for their reliable and safe storage.		###
J0805808035	Characterization of microbial processes in deep aquifers of the Fennoscandian Shield	Micro-organisms must be included in any hydrogeochemical modelling efforts in the ongoing Swedish programme to characterize potential sites for the geological disposal of spent nuclear fuel. This paper presents the development and testing of several methods for estimating the total numbers of micro-organism groups and amounts of their biomass in groundwater, their diversity, and the rates of microbial processes. The enumeration and cultivation methods were tested and evaluated on groundwater from boreholes at 450 m depth in the ~:Asp~:o Hard Rock Laboratory (HRL), Sweden, and from two potential sites for a final repository of spent nuclear fuel, Forsmark and Laxemar. The reproducibility of the methods between parallel samples and over time was investigated and found to be excellent. Nitrate-, iron-, manganese- and sulphate-reducing bacteria and acetogens and methanogens were found in numbers up to approximately 87,000 cells L{_-1} groundwater from the studied sites. A methodology that analysed microbial process rates was developed and tested under open and closed controlled in situ conditions in a circulation system situated 447 m underground in the MICROBE laboratory at the ~:Asp~:o HRL. The sulphide and acetate production rates were determined to be 0.08 and 0.14 mg L{_-1} day{_-1}, respectively. The numbers of sulphide- and acetate-producing micro-organisms increased concomitantly in the analysed circulating groundwater. Flushing the sampled circulation aquifer created an artefact, as it lowered the sulphide concentration. Microbial and inorganic processes involved in sulphur transformations are summarized in a conceptual model, based on the observations and results presented here. The model outlines how dissolved sulphide may react with Fe(III) and Fe(II) to form solid phases of iron sulphide and pyrite. Sulphide will, consequently, continuously be removed from the aqeous phase via these reactions, at a rate approximately equalling the rate of production by microbial sulphate reduction.		###
J08423714116	Explicit eigenvalue estimates for transfer operators acting on spaces of holomorphic functions	We consider transfer operators actdng on spaces of holomorphic functions, and provide explicit bounds for their eigenvalues. More precisely, if _W is any open set in C{d}, and L is a suitable transfer operator acting on Bergman space A{2}(_W), its eigenvalue sequence ~(_l[n](L)~) is bounded by |_l[n](L)|_<A exp(-an{1/d}), where a,A>0 are explicitly given.
